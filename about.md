<p>Hi, I'm Prajwal! and I am an Engineer</p>

<p>I was born in Bengaluru, India and was always amazed by technology and machines. Growing up, I couldn't help myself from fidgeting with all the appliances at home. An Engineering degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering was the perfect way to funnel my interests towards a direction.</p>

<p>You can say I am a tech passionate and self-driven individual with a hardware tinkering addiction, with a love for of Astronomy, Electronics and History.</p>

<p>I love creating stuff and blogging on topics that intrigue me. Hang around if you find my content interesting! :) </p>
